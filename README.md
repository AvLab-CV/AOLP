# Application-Oriented License Plate Recognition
By Hsu, Gee-Sern and Chen, Jiun-Chang and Chung, Yu-Zu


AOLP contains 2,049 images, with various locations, time, tracffic, and weather conditions. The whole dataset is categorized into three subsets, and each subset offers a good scope of samples to represent one of the three major applications (i.e., access control, law enforcement and road patrol).

Access control refers to the cases that a vehicle passes a fixed passage at a reduced speed or with a full stop, such as at a toll station or the entrance/exit of a region.

Traffic law enforcement refers to the cases that a vehicle travels at a regular or higher speed but violates traffic laws, such as a traffic signal or speed limit, and is captured by a roadside camera. 757 images were collected for this application category.

Road patrol refers to the cases that the camera is installed or handheld on a patrolling vehicle which takes images of the vehicles with arbitrary viewpoints and distances. 

We hope that the AOLP database could revolutionized the landscape of license plate research, and serve as a fair comparison dataset to facilitate future studies of license plate recognition. A detailed introduction of IMDb-Face can be found in the paper(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6339122).




Here are some examples from the dataset.
